There are two notebooks, one for each Question.
For both the questions, I have taken the S&P500 Index and Apple Stock.

Q1:
  Every day in the first (09:30) entry of S&P500, the volume was shown to be 0 while other values were present.
  This was not the case with the Apple stock which had no 0 entries.
  There was a significant difference between the hourly and the corresponding daily values:
    a. The opening price for 9:30 was not the opening price for the day, similarly for the closing price.
    b. The highs and lows of daily data are not highs and lows of any hour.
  These differences indicate that the hourly data is raw and not adjusted like the daily data.
  I have calculated the cumulative return over a period as the return on an investment while all the daily returns during said period are reinvested.
  I have used the adjusted closing price for calculating the daily and cumulative returns to accommodate for splits and dividends.
  Apple provided a 75% higher cumulative return over a 1 year period as compared to the S&P500 Index.
  The daily returns of Apple fluctuated highly, both gaining and losing more than 4% on certain days.
  The S&P500 Index seemed more stable, having a lower range of daily returns.
  The trends in both seemed highly correlated, rising and falling together. However, these trends affected Apple with higher magnitude. 
  This suggests that individual stocks like Apple respond to market effects at a higher proportional while Indices tend to be more stable.

Q2:
